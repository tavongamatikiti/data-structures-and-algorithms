# Data Structures and Algorithms

Welcome to the Data Structures and Algorithms repository! This repository is designed to help you strengthen your problem-solving skills and gain a deep understanding of various data structures and algorithms. The repository will be organized into two main folders for easy navigation.

### Repository Structure

This repository will have two main folders, each containing coding challenges and solutions from popular coding platforms:

1. **CodeWars** - Solutions to problems from [CodeWars](https://www.codewars.com/), organized by difficulty level and topic.

2. **LeetCode** - Solutions to problems from [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/), including explanations and optimizations where applicable.

Each folder contains:

- **Problem Statement** - The challenge description from the platform.
- **Solution Code** - The implementation of the solution in a variety of programming languages where possible.
- **Explanation** - Comments and documentation explaining the logic and optimizations.

### How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/tavongamatikiti/data-structures-and-algorithms.git
   ```
